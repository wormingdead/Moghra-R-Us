## Installation

1. Install the mod by downloading this repository and placing it in the Caves of Qud `Mods` folder, located in the Caves of Qud user data folder, next to `Saves`.
    - Alternatively, see below for the Steam Workshop page.
2. Launch Caves of Qud and make sure you have mods enabled in the options. *Moghra'R'Us* should appear in the mod list.
3. Enable *Moghra'R'Us*, then start a new game or load a save.
    - If loading a save, there will be a warning about active mods not matching the save. Select the option that uses the currently loaded mods.
