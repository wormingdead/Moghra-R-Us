# JangleSnap

### Game Pieces

- 4 Dice
  - 3 six-sided dice and 1 four-sided die
- A line that demarcates two places to roll dice
- ~~Something to represent the line at eye level (a reed stalk, etc.)~~

### Rules Of Play

Each player stands opposite the other, with the line dividing the space between into left and right. Each player rolls two dice, aiming to have one die land on each side of the line, resulting in two dice total on each side. Each player must roll their dice with one hand (appendage). After every roll, the player's left side, denoted by the line, will have two rolled dice, the values of which will be the player's result.

If no verdict can be made from each player's result, each player takes the dice on their left side and rolls again, aiming again for a die on each side of the line.

### Ending A Game

- A player's dice result may win or lose them the game.
- A player failing to have a die land on each side.
- Getting caught cheating.
- Moving from the position opposite the opponent.

### Game Etiquette

- Throwing the dice so that they collide with the other player's dice is considered skillful play as it is a potential counter play for manipulated throws and a good way to keep dice from flying out of the play zone.
- The name comes from the rhythm of the **Jangle** of the noise maker that signals the throw, (seeds in a hollowed piece of wood, or similar) and the **Snap** of the dice colliding.
- Generally, it is good practice to have some third party or environment effect perform the **Jangle**, so that a player cannot be accused of breaking the rhythm.

## TODO

- What sides do the dice have?
- What is a winning result?
- What is a losing result?
- How many ways are there to cheat?
- ~~How do players coordinate rolling dice?~~
- What happens when there are spectators?
- Maybe rolling one Spindle wins and getting two loses?
- Maybe one of the dice is a different shape? Maybe has more losing sides or fewer sides and players trade which side it's on.
- Come up with poem to explain the rules.

# Rules Memonics

*To buy and sell wares, be a Wanderer prepared, \
To open your stand, carry drams in two hands.*

*All Foragers must heed, against the Young Ivory defend, \
You may afford to bleed, but twice bloodied is the end.*

*Merchant's take stock, unless your title's all talk, \
To claim victory, your drams must total three (or more). \
But any brine in your tent, your trade you must relent, \
And if I smell only brine, your drams are mine.*
